#ELIZA TO BETH CONVERTER #

##v0.0.1##

LATEST: Fixed a problem with some substitutions ending up undefined (#3).
This is very much a work in progress.

#WHAT IS THIS?#

It's currently a simple webpage for converting Eliza data to that probably needed by [Beth](https://github.com/guypursey/Beth). To use, simply open the webpage, paste your Eliza ruleset in JSON format into the left-hand side and click the 'Convert' button that then appears. The Beth-style ruleset should then appear on the right-hand side.

Further documentation and improvements to be made available in due course.
